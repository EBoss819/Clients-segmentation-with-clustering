# Clients-segmentation-with-clustering
## Openclassroom project nÂ°5

This project made me create automaticly a clustering of clients database in order to make a marketing campain for the few selected clients.
After a first clustering at a given date, i needed to find out when to do the clustering again to update it.

The first notebook is the data exploration and some cleaning
The second and third notebooks are for the clustering itself, and the updating period research.
